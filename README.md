A personal project to provide simple [click](https://github.com/pallets/click) tool easily without almost no setup and to build files, etc that I seem to have written multiple times e.g. setup.py
 

 project to automate things I seem to have done multiple times and 

Install:
```
pip install wack
```

Setup:
```
wack init
```

This will make a wack.py file in the directory you're in. My recommendation is to do this in the root dir.
 


#### TODO
* install dotenv
* pre-commit
